        <strong>What’s a cookie?</strong> A cookie is a small data file that individual websites store on your computer’s hard drive – if your web browser permits. The website can later retrieve that cookie to let us know you’ve been to our site before, among other things. Cookies typically make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a secure site. Many websites use cookies. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do that.

        <br>
        <strong>What’s an IP address?</strong> An IP address is a unique number, assigned to each and every computer and other device on the Internet. Your computer, your phone, your e-reader, and other electronic devices, are all assigned IP addresses.

        <strong>When does Operation Meraki collect this information?</strong>
        We collect non-personal information from you as you use any of the pages on our website.
